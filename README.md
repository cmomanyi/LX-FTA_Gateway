# LX-FTA_Gateway
This project simulates a secure smart agriculture network using four types of sensors that transmit data to a gateway (LX-FTA), which processes and securely sends this data to a simulated cloud API. The project emphasizes wireless transmission, encryption, authentication, and attack resilience.
