## 🌱 Sensor Data Display (Optional Add-on)

This dashboard can also simulate and display **real-time sensor data** for use in smart agriculture, IoT, or monitoring systems.

### Supported Sensor Types

- **Soil Sensors:** moisture, temperature, pH, nitrogen, phosphorus
- **Atmospheric Sensors:** air temperature, humidity, CO₂, wind speed, rainfall
- **Plant Sensors:** leaf moisture, chlorophyll, growth rate, disease risk, stem diameter
- **Water Sensors:** flow rate, water level, salinity, pH, turbidity
- **Threat Detection Sensors:** unauthorized access, jamming, tampering, spoofing, anomaly score

### UI Features

- Sensor Type dropdown (e.g., soil, atmospheric, water, etc.)
- Sensor ID selection
- Real-time chart updates (line and bar charts)
- Error message handling for unauthorized access or sensor failure

### Integration Notes

Make sure your frontend includes:
- Dropdown to choose sensor type and sensor ID
- Chart rendering components (`react-chartjs-2`)
- Optional WebSocket connection to stream real-time sensor data from a backend (e.g., FastAPI)

## ✅ Final Notes

- Make sure you do **not** expose sensitive keys in production (EmailJS public key is safe for frontend)
- All events are logged via toasts and also trigger email notifications
